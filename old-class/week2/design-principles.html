                </div>
                <p>The Hotjar homepage is a good example of the principle of Fitts Law.
                    According to Interaction Design Foundation on their website, interaction-design.org,
                    "Fitts’ law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer 
                    (e.g., mouse cursor) to a target area is a function of the distance to the target 
                    divided by the size of the target. Thus, the longer the distance and the smaller 
                    the target’s size, the longer it takes." What this means, in regards to web design is 
                    that the bigger the button to click on, the more accessible it is to the user and much more 
                    likely to be clicked. Hotjar's website shows this principle by drawing all of the users attention to
                    the buttons on the screen. They do this through size (making the buttons bigger than the type), 
                    color(making the color bold and standout different from the rest fo the page), and location in 
                    relation to other elements (by placing the buttons where the users eyes are more likely to look - the top and
                    middle/left of the page).

                </div>
                <p>Nike is a perfect example of repetition. Most people know Nike's logo of the 'swoop' 
                    because of the repetitive way they use it. Not only is it everywhere on their 
                    merchandise, but small and large images of their logo are scattered throughout their 
                    webpage. By placing their well known swoop in areas where the users eyes naturally fall,
                    Nike is cementing their brand further into the users mind.

            <h3>Dropbox</h3>
            <a href ="https://www.dropbox.com/">www.dropbox.com</a><br>
            <div id="DropBox">
                <img  src="images/dropbox2.png" alt="Image of Dropbox Homepage">
            </div>
            <p>Dropbox utilizes their white space in a very professional manner. Their website is jampacked
                with information but it does not feel that way because of the way DropBox is able to 
                incorporate white space into its design. They have many icons that they then 
                give a title, then a brief description as well as having links to other pages. Space surrounds each of
                these points, creating a flow fleeing instead of being crammed together.
