        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Site Name</h3>
        <p>I chose the name, Newport County Chamber of Commerce. I chose this name because I grew up in Newport, R.I. and know this town. 
            I know the geography and the businesses. Not only do I know these things but I understand how living on an island that caters to tourists in the summer 
            but still has to survive the rest of the year, can affect local businesses and commercial and personal real estate.
        </p>

        <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
        <p>Newport Chamber of Commerce will promote business and community development. It will be a resource for local businesses to create contacts and thrive. 
            It will be a resource for information for those wanting to know more about the community.
